            <h2>What are movie genres?</h2>
            <p>Movie genres encompass distinct categories that classify films based on various elements such as tone, theme, plot, characters, and mood. These classifications serve to categorize movies into specific groups. Additionally, within the realm of movie genres, there exist sub-genres, which represent smaller, more specialized categories formed through the fusion of two distinct genres. Movie genres and sub-genres mutually impact and shape one another.</p>
            <p>Several factors contribute to the definition of movie genres, foremost among them being the ability to delineate a particular style of entertainment. Furthermore, movie genres possess the power to influence the emergence and development of sub-genres, as well as the potential to merge with other genres to create hybrid classifications.</p>
