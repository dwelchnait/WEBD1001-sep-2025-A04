         name="viewport"
            The viewport is the visible area of a web page in the browser window. 
            On desktops it’s usually the browser window, but on mobile devices it’s 
            the screen area available for content.

         content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
             width=device-width
                Sets the page’s viewport width to match the device’s screen width 
                    (e.g., 375px on an iPhone, 1920px on a desktop).
                Without this, a mobile browser might zoom out and render as if it
                    were 980px wide, making text tiny.

             initial-scale=1.0
                Sets the initial zoom level when the page loads.
                1.0 means 100% (no zoom).
                For example, 0.5 would show the page zoomed out (everything smaller), 
                   and 2.0 would zoom in.
