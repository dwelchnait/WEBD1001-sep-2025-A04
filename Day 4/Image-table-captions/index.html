        <h1>Figure and Table Elements</h1>
        <h2>What is the figure element and why use it?</h2>
        <p>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, 
            that is self-contained (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced 
            as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>
        <p>It is a semantic tag that tells the browser that these items have a relation to each other.</p>
        <p>The figure is the parent element, and the img and figcaption elements are children nested inside.</p>

        <!-- 
        using a caption with an image
        structure:    figure
                        img (you can have as many images as you wish)
                        [figcaption]
                      figure
        the figcaption can be place before or after your image
        Even though you COULD place a caption before and after your image, it does NOT
           mean your should. If you do try, you will discover that the W3C validator will
           object to having multiple captions within your figure tag!!!!!

         <h2>HTML Tables</h2>
        <p>The table element represents data with more than one dimension, 
        in the form of a table.</p>

        <!--
            The table tag has several internal tags used to create the table structure.
